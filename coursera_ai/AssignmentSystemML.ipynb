    "## Understaning scaling of linear algebra operations on Apache Spark using Apache SystemML\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we want you to understand how to scale linear algebra operations from a single machine to multiple machines, memory and CPU cores using Apache SystemML. Therefore we want you to understand how to migrate from a numpy program to a SystemML DML program. Don't worry. We will give you a lot of hints. Finally, you won't need this knowledge anyways if you are sticking to Keras only, but once you go beyond that point you'll be happy to see what's going on behind the scenes.\n",

Therefore we've stripped down the example to smaller matrices below, but we've kept the code, just in case you are curious to check it out. But you might want to use some more workers which you easily can configure in the environment settings of the project within Watson Studio. Just be aware that you're currently limited to free 50 capacity unit hours per month wich are consumed by the additional workers."
